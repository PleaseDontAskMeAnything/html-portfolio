<h1>The Best Movies of all time.</h1>

<h2>Top5</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Inception</h3>

<p>
    A classic Christopher Nolan film; the movie follows a professional thief who specializes in stealing ideas by infiltrating their minds, however
    in the movie, he was given a mission to implant an idea to a businessman to destroy his own company (not so unethical when you watch it, still evil).

<h3>3 Idiots</h3>

<p>
    My fav Indian movie of all time, 3 Idiots is a satire on the education system in India and the lack of its mental toll on Indian students.
</p>

<h3>Shutter Island</h3>

<p>
    A classic Scorsese film, and his best one yet. Shutter Island follows a US Marshal and his partner travel to this Island called, (you know what it is),
    to investigate about a woman's dissapearance. As the story progresses, we find that the things in the Island are not what they appear to be,
    and there's a lot going on, a lot of UNEXPECTED things, even for the protagonist of the film.

<h3>Interstellar</h3>

<p>
    Dare I not add this film to this list, a cult classic, another one of Nolan's film here. The movie follows a dystopian not-so-far future setting
    in which a team of astronauts travel through a wormhole to inspect certain promising lands to inhabit for all of humanity as Earth is seemingly
    out of resources. As cool as it sounds, its even cooler as you engage in the movie with its mind blowing visuals, its accuracy to multiple science
    related stuff, fantastic acting from the case, to each their own, the music by the legendary Hans Zimmer.

<h3>Mad Max: Fury Road</h3>

<p>
    Recently having watched this film, Mad Max: Fury Road is without a doubt one of the greatest action films of all time. Personally, its my favourite
    action film of all time. With a rich story in mind, George Miller returns to make a fourth Mad Max film, this time with an greater vision in mind while
    making this film. The spectacle of the film is huge with the performances from the cast and the background work from the crew making it a top notch
    film. Truly a "one of its kind" film. Mad Max is pretty much just, Max going mad in an even madder (if the term exists) world. He's surrounded by
    savages, beasts, a hell of its own kind and its all about his survival.
