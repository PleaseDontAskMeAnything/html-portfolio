<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>
  Just a simple guy who is passionate about the Science of Computers around the world. I am currently a senior year undergraduate at California 
  State University, Sacramento, obviously majoring in Computer Science. ALthough I am super fond of Computer Science, I must confess I am somewhat
  average in programming. Nevertheless, I am committed to learn more, to help more people, to seek guidance, and give it my all. Putting my academic
  life aside, I am also a big fan of watching movies, despite not watching many popular films out there. A semi-contradictory personality here, I am
  fairly optimistic, fairly cautious, somewhat passive-agressive with learning, and I believe I am a good teammate and an even better friend.
